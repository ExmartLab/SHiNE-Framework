# Environment

To simulate human interaction within smart environments under controlled temporal conditions, the simulation engine allows 
configurable virtual time settings. The virtual environment includes a time system that is independent of real-world time, 
enabling flexible pacing and repeatability of experiments. The temporal dimension of the simulation is critical for studying 
tasks that are dependent on the time of day, for example morning routines, lighting automation, or energy consumption patterns. 

This configurable time model enables experiments to simulate realistic routines or to compress longer interactions into shorter 
test sessions, without altering the behavior logic of devices or users.

## Time

The time configuration is defined using a structured schema with two main parameters:

1. `startTime`: Specifies the initial in-game time at the onset of the scenario. This is set 
using a 24-hour format with `hour` and `minute` fields:
    - `hour`: Integer, representing the hour of the day to start from (0-23)
    - `minute`: Integer, representing minute of the hour to start from (0-59)

This allows researchers to situate the task within a specific temporal context, for example, 
setting the `startTime` to (hour: 8, minute: 0) to simulate a user's interaction with a 
smart coffee machine as part of a morning routine.


2. `speed`(Time Progression Speed): Integer, that controls the rate at which simulated time advances relative to real-world time.

A value of 1 corresponds to real-time progression, while higher values accelerate time (e.g., 10 simulates ten seconds per real second), allowing long-duration tasks to be observed within manageable experiment durations.


`in-game Time Progression` = `Speed` × `Real-World Time Progression`.

#### Example

```json
{
    "environment": {
        "time": {
            "startTime": {
                "hour": 8,
                "minute": 0
            },
            "speed": 1
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration starts the game at 8:00 AM with real-time progression.

### Accelerated Evening Scenario

```json
{
    "environment": {
        "time": {
            "startTime": {
                "hour": 22,
                "minute": 0
            },
            "speed": 10
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration:
- Starts at 10:00 PM (useful for testing evening/night rules)
- Runs 10x faster than real-time
- Allows experiencing several hours of game time in minutes

### Morning Rush Simulation

```json
{
    "environment": {
        "time": {
            "startTime": {
                "hour": 6,
                "minute": 30
            },
            "speed": 5
        }
    }
}
```

This setup simulates a morning routine:
- Starts at 6:30 AM
- 5x speed allows participants to experience morning activities quickly
- Perfect for testing morning-specific smart home automations

### Precise Timing Scenario

```json
{
    "environment": {
        "time": {
            "startTime": {
                "hour": 14,
                "minute": 45
            },
            "speed": 2.5
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration demonstrates:
- Starting at 2:45 PM
- 2.5x speed for moderate acceleration
- Useful for mid-day scenarios with specific timing requirements
