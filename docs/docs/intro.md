# Introduction

This is the documentation for the **virtual smart home study platform** . The primary contribution of our work is a versatile framework that provides researchers with the necessary tools to construct, configure, and deploy simulated explainable smart home environments. These generated environments serve as controlled, replicable testbeds designed specifically to facilitate user studies, allowing researchers to effectively evaluate key performance indicators, such as effectiveness, usability, and user trust, of their own intelligent systems.
