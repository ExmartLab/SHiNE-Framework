# Environment

To simulate human interaction within smart environments under controlled temporal conditions, the simulation engine allows 
configurable virtual time settings. The virtual environment includes a time system that is independent of real-world time, 
enabling flexible pacing and repeatability of experiments. The temporal dimension of the simulation is critical for studying 
tasks that are dependent on the time of day, for example morning routines, lighting automation, or energy consumption patterns. 

This configurable time model enables experiments to simulate realistic routines or to compress longer interactions into shorter 
test sessions, without altering the behavior logic of devices or users.

## Time

The time configuration is defined using a structured schema with two main parameters:

1. `startTime`: Specifies the initial in-game time at the onset of the scenario. This is set 
using a 24-hour format with `hour` and `minute` fields:
    - `hour`: Integer, representing the hour of the day to start from (0-23)
    - `minute`: Integer, representing minute of the hour to start from (0-59)

This allows researchers to situate the task within a specific temporal context, for example, 
setting the `startTime` to (hour: 8, minute: 0) to simulate a user's interaction with a 
smart coffee machine as part of a morning routine.


2. `speed`(Time Progression Speed): Integer, that controls the rate at which simulated time advances relative to real-world time.

A value of 1 corresponds to real-time progression, while higher values accelerate time (e.g., 10 simulates ten seconds per real second), allowing long-duration tasks to be observed within manageable experiment durations.


`in-game Time Progression` = `Speed` × `Real-World Time Progression`.

#### Example

```json
{
    "time": {
        "startTime": {
            "hour": 8,
            "minute": 0
        },
        "speed": 1
    }
}
```
