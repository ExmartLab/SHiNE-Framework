# Configuration

To configure the game, both JSON files `game.json` and `explanation.json` is required in the folder `platform/src/*`.

Both files configure the game, such as task, environment, room layout, rules and the underlying explanation engine.
Currently, both files are present, so they can be modified easily to your needs. 

For an overview of the configuration, consider reading the subpages of this section for a detailed explanation of their function.
