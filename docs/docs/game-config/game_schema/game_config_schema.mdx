# Game Config Schema

The `game.json` file defines the full structure of a smart home simulation used in our game-based studies. It coordinates all key components that drive user experience, system behavior, and experimental logic.

This configuration includes:
- The **environment** context (e.g., current time, temprature, weather, etc. within the simulated smart home)
- The **rules** that govern smart home automation
- A set of **tasks** players must complete
- Definitions for **rooms**, **walls**, and **doors**
- Interactive **devices** with properties and states

Each section is defined as a modular schema and can be validated independently. For detailed documentation, refer to the dedicated pages for each section below:

| Section            | Description                                    | Details                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Environment**     | Contextual variables that may influence rules | [Environment Schema](./environment) |
| **Rules**           | Automation logic that reacts to environment and devices | [Rules Schema](./rules) |
| **Tasks**           | Experimental tasks with goals, device resets, and timers | [Tasks Schema](./tasks) |
| **Rooms & Walls**   | Visual and navigational layout of the house   | [Walls & Rooms Schema](./walls) |
| **Devices**         | Smart home devices with states and properties | [Devices Schema](./devices) |
| **Device Interaction** | Device action/state schemas (numerical, boolean, etc.) | [Interaction Schema](./interaction_types) |
