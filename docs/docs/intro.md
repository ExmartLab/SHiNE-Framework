# Introduction

Welcome to **V-SHiNE: Virtual Smart Home with iNtelligent and Explainability Features**!

The **V-SHiNE** framework provides a powerful and flexible platform for researchers to design, configure, and deploy **simulated explainable smart home environments**. The core contribution of our work lies in offering a **versatile, customizable, and replicable testbed** that enables the **systematic evaluation of explainability aspects** under controlled conditions.

By integrating configurable explanations and comprehensive logging mechanisms, V-SHiNE supports a broad range of experimental setups, making it particularly suitable for advancing research in **explainable smart environments**, **cyber-physical systems**, and **human-computer interaction**.
