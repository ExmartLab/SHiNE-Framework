# Environment

The environment can be used to adjust the environment of the scenario and is used for managing the concept of time.

## JSON Schema

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={ EnvironmentSchema } />

<InlineSchemaDisplay 
  schema={EnvironmentSchema} 
  resolverOptions={generateResolverOptions({"basePath": "/schemas"})} 
  title="Environment Schema"
/>

## Time

This section configures how time is handled in the application. Here is a breakdown:

1. `startTime`: JSON defining the ingame time at the commence of the game, including
    - `hour`: Integer, representing the hour of the day to start from (in 24-hour format)
    - `minute`: Integer, representing minute of the hour to start from
2. `speed`: Integer, indicating the speed at which time progresses within the application

A `speed`value of `1` means that time progresses at a normal rate (real-time). A number greater than `1` accelerates time, and a number less than `1` slows it down. Setting speed to `2` would make time progress twice as fast, meaning one real-world second equals two ingame seconds.
Accordingly, `ingame Time Progression` = `Speed` × `Real-World Time Progression`.

#### Example

```json
{
    "time": {
        "startTime": {
            "hour": 8,
            "minute": 0
        },
        "speed": 1
    }
}
```
