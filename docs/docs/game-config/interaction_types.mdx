# Interaction Types

The dynamic properties of a device are defined through interaction types.
These define in a clear way the current value, the value range if exist and the definition.
There are multiple forms of interaction types, such as numerical interaction or boolean action which are defined below.

## Numerical Action

A numerical action is a dynamic property for numerical values. It takes values in the pre-defined range at predefined steps.

Numerical actions are useful to depict discrete values of a device, such as temperature of an oven or the degree of grinding of a coffee machine.

### Example for a numerical action

Let's assume we have a deep fryer with the option to set the temperature in discrete steps. Therefore, the `name` is set to `Temperature`. This will be displayed in the smart home panel for viewing the current value and to adjust the value.

Also, the data type is set to  `Integer`. Further, the unit of measure, denoted by `unitOfMeasure`, is in Celsius or `°C`. The unit of measure will be displayed along with the current value.

#### Value Range

The temperature can be adjusted in the range from 0 to 250. Therefore, the `Range` is set to `[0, 250]`. Furthermore, the steps or `Interval` between the values within the range shall be `25`. Therefore, the following 11 values can be accepted: `0`, `25`, `50`, `75`, `100`, `125`, `150`, `175`, `200`, `225`, `250`.

#### Current State

The current state of the temperature upon game start is set to zero or `0` for the value within `currentState`.

#### Visibility Property

Furthermore, the interaction is visible for adjustment under the condition that another interaction type `Power` equals true, i.e., the deep fryer is turned on.
Additionally, the interaction can be set to read-only by setting `visible` to `false`.
If no constraints should apply, `visible` can be set to `null`.

```json
{
    "InteractionType": "Numerical_Action",
    "name": "Temperature",
    "inputData": {
            "valueType": ["PrimitiveType", "Integer"],
            "unitOfMeasure": "°C",
        "type": {
            "Range": [0, 250],
            "Interval": [25]
        }
    },
    "currentState": {
        "visible": [
            { "name": "Power", "value": true }
        ],
        "value": 0
    }
}
```

## Boolean Action

A boolean action is a dynamic property for boolean values. It takes either the state one or zero which maps to the device state.

This encompasses the ON/OFF state of a device or a mode accepting one of two values.

### Example of a Boolean Action

Let's assume again that we have a deep fryer that can be turned on or off which we name it as `Power`. This is realized through a boolean action.

#### Value Mapping

We can map the two state of the boolean action to a device value within `type`. In the following example,
we wish to map the True-State (so value = 1) to `On`,
whereas we wish to map the False-State (so value = 0) to `Off`.

#### Current state

The current state can be set in the varialbe `value` within `currentState` to `true` (= On) or `false` (= Off).

#### Visibility Property

As in numerical interaction, the interaction property is visible for adjustment under the condition that another interaction type `Power` equals true, i.e., the deep fryer is turned on.
Additionally, the interaction can be set to read-only by setting `visible` to `false`.
If no constraints should apply, `visible` can be set to `null`.

```json
{
    "InteractionType": "Boolean_Action",
    "name": "Power",
    "inputData": {
        "valueType": ["PrimitiveType", "Boolean"],
        "unitOfMeasure": null,
        "type": {
            "True": "On",
            "False": "Off"
        }
    },
    "currentState": {
        "visible": null,
        "value": false
    }
}
```
