# Installation

This guide covers the installation requirements and setup process for the V-SHINE Study Platform.

## Requirements

### For Local Development
- **Node.js 22** (Virtual Study Platform)
- **MongoDB** (Database)
- **MongoDB Compass** (GUI - optional but recommended)
- **Python 3** (Explanation Engine - optional)

### For Production
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

## Local Development Setup

### Node.js 22 Installation

To install Node.js, visit https://nodejs.org/en and download Node.js v22.15.1 (LTS as of May 21st, 2025).

During installation, simply click 'Next'/'Continue' in the installation wizard as no extra packages are needed. It's recommended to restart your PC after installation to ensure all changes take effect.

### MongoDB Installation

Install MongoDB Community Server from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.

For detailed installation instructions specific to your operating system, follow the official guides at https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/.

### MongoDB Compass Installation (Optional)

MongoDB Compass provides a GUI for managing your MongoDB databases. Download it from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass and select the appropriate version for your operating system.

### Platform Setup

Once the prerequisites are installed, set up the platform:

1. Navigate to the platform directory:
```bash
cd platform
```

2. Configure MongoDB connection (optional). The default values are:
   - MongoDB URI: `mongodb://localhost:27017/smart-home-study`
   - Database: `smart-home-study`

   To override defaults, create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/smart-home-study
MONGODB_DB=smart-home-study
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production Setup with Docker

### Initial Setup

For the first time setup, run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Starting/Stopping the Server

For subsequent runs:
```bash
docker-compose start
```

To stop the server:
```bash
docker-compose stop
```

### Rebuilding Docker Images

If you need to force rebuild the Docker image:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Documentation Setup

The documentation is built with Docusaurus and requires Node.js.

1. Navigate to the docs directory:
```bash
cd docs
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run start
```

## Configuration

The platform's game configuration file is located at `src/game.json`. Modify this file to customize the platform's behavior and settings.
