# Explanation Engine

This documentation guides on how to integrate an explanation engine to the study.
Two approaches exist integrating explanation, by using the integrated one or a custom API endpoint. Both approaches are detailed below

## Core Configuration

In the core configuration, the design of the explanation system can be adjusted.
These are the time of when explanations are issued and the type of explanation system used.

### Property: Explanation Trigger

There are multiple ways exist to trigger an explanation which is described below

- `on_demand`: Explanations can be shown on demand, in particular, when an user requests an explanation via a button push. In this case, the explanations whose conditions apply will be shown.
- `automatic`: If one of the condititions of a rule apply, an explanation will be issued automatically to the end-user (only for integrated explanation-engine)
- `system`: Similarly to `automatic`, the external engine decides when to show an explanation based on the received payload

### Property: Explanation Engine

The type back-bone of the explanation engine can be adjusted here.

One can decide to use the integrated explanation engine which is suitable for simple explanation that do not depend on complex logic and dynamicity.

Alternatively, an external explanation engine can be used for cases that goes beyond the limits of the external explanation engine.
If an external explanation engine is used, one needs to specify the URL in `external_explanation_engine_api`.

Therefore, the property `explanation_engine` accepts two values:
- `integrated`: For the use of the integrated explanation engine
- `external`: For the use of the external explanation engine

## Explanation Engines

In the following, both types of the explanation engines integrated or an external one will be detailed.

### Integrated Explanation Rule Engine

The integrated explanation rule engine simplifies setting up new rules along with associated explanations.

#### Setup

If one chooses the explanation engine, the core properties should be adjusted as follow:
- `explanation_engine` needs to be set to `integrated`.
- `explanation_trigger` needs to be either set to `on_demand` or `manual`.

#### When is an explanation shown?

Depending on the configuration of `explanation_trigger`, an explanation will be shown on-demand or manually.

When setting up manually, the explanations will be shown whenever all conditions of an explanation object will apply.

In the on-demand setting, it's similarly realised by storing the latest explanation that gets changed whenever the conditions of an explanation object applies.
If a user requests an explanation, the latest explanation will be retrieved and then shown to the user. In other words, the explanation won't be disclosed until requested by the user.

#### Create new Explanation

To create new explanation for the internal explanation engine, a JSON object need to be defined in the JSON object `integrated_explanation_engine` with the key being the ID of the explanation and the value the explanation itself.

```json
{
    "integrated_explanation_engine": {
        "explanation_id": "explanation_text"
    }
}
```


### External Explanation Engine

The external explanation engine allows for greater customization and suitable for already existing explanation engines.

#### Setup

If one chooses the explanation engine, it should be decided between REST API or Websockets, therefore the core properties should be adjusted as follow:
- `explanation_engine` needs to be set to `external`.
- `external_engine_type` needs to be set either to `ws` or `rest`
- `explanation_trigger` needs to be either set to `on_demand` or `system`.

For REST:
- `external_explanation_engine_api`: URL of the explanation engine, e.g., `https://example.com/engine` (without slash at the end).

For Websockets:
- `external_explanation_engine`: URL of the Websocket server, e.g., `ws://example.com`

#### Explanation Engine via REST API

This documentation is intended if one uses the REST API communication

The explanation engine requires two endpoints of the API:
- `/logger`: The standard endpoint, called when the user interacted within the game and caused new logs to be sent to the endpoint.
- `/explanation`: If an user requests an explanation on-demand, this endpoint will be called

Both endpoints will be called with a general JSON payload consisting of the user ID:

```json
{
    "user_id": "64bdb062-cb25-487f-8373-c56ac18fba5a"
}
```

If the external explanation engine API is https://example.com/engine, then the endpoints are as follow specified
- https://example.com/engine/logger
- https://example.com/engine/explanation


##### Endpoint: `/logger`

The `/logger` endpoint will be called whenever the user interacted with a device or performed some actions within the game, leading to logging of its activities.
These logging activities are transmitted to the endpoint whenever a new log is available. In addition, meta-data of the devices and environments are also included.
In the REST interface, all logged data will be transmitted within `logs`.

The example JSON payload follows the example:

```json
{
    "user_id": "64bdb062-cb25-487f-8373-c56ac18fba5a",
    "current_task": "make_coffee",
    "ingame_time": "08:32",
    "environment": [
        { "name": "Weather", "value": "Sunny" },
        { "name": "Temperature", "value": 20 }
    ],
    "devices": [
        {
            "device": "deep_fryer",
            "interactions": [
                {
                    "name": "Power",
                    "value": true
                },
                {
                    "name": "Temperature",
                    "value": 150
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "device": "coffee_machine",
            "interactions": [
                {
                    "name": "Power",
                    "value": true
                },
                {
                    "name": "Roasting",
                    "value": true
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "logs": [
        {
            "type": "DEVICE_INTERACTION",
            "device_id": "deep_fryer",
            "interaction": {
                "name": "Power",
                "value": true
            },
            "timestamp": 1739280520
        },
        {
            "type": "DEVICE_INTERACTION",
            "device_id": "coffee_machine",
            "interaction": {
                "name": "Power",
                "value": true
            },
            "timestamp": 1739280574
        }
    ]
}
```

The API response of the endpoint is dedicated in the following section.

##### Endpoint: `/explanation`

The `/explanation` endpoint will be called whenever a user requests an explanation on-demand via button click.

The API endpoint will be sent with the user ID and optionally with the user-passed message.

**Standard Explanation Request**

```json
{
    "user_id": "64bdb062-cb25-487f-8373-c56ac18fba5a"
}
```

**Explanation Request with user message**

```json
{
    "user_id": "64bdb062-cb25-487f-8373-c56ac18fba5a",
    "user_message": "User message ..."
}
```

To pass user-messages to the explanation engine, the setting `allow_user_message` must be set to `true`.

The API response of the endpoint is dedicated in the next section

##### API Response 

The API response should return the HTTP code 200 if successful.
Further, if an explanation should be shown for the API endpoint `/logger` or `/explanation`, the response should follow the output:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "show_explanation": true,
    "explanation": "..."
}
```

On the contrary, if no explanations is shown, the response should follow the output:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "show_explanation": false
}
```

    "user_message": "Message"
}
```

**Field Descriptions**
- `user_id`: Identifier for the user
- `timestamp`: Timestamp of the event

###### Incoming: Explanation Receival

To receive the explanations back, the channel `explanation_receival` will be listened for new incoming explanations.

It should follow the JSON payload:
```json
{
    "user_id": "64bdb062-cb25-487f-8373-c56ac18fba5a",
    "explanation": "It's me, an explanation!"
}
```

**Field Descriptions**
- `user_id`: Identifier for the user
- `explanation`: Explanation

**Implementation Notes**
- All timestamps are provided in Unix timestamp format

**Error Handling**
Clients should implement appropriate error handling for:
- Connection interruptions
- Invalid payload formats
- Missing required fields

**Security Considerations**
- Validate all incoming payloads
- Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms
- Monitor for unusual patterns in event frequency
