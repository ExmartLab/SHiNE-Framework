# Rules


Rules are used to create smart home interacttions. They define conditions that must be met before a rule's action is executed.

## JSON Schema

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={ RuleSchema } resolverOptions={generateResolverOptions({"basePath": "/schemas"})} />

<details>
    <summary>JSON Schema Code</summary>

    <InlineSchemaDisplay 
    schema={RuleSchema} 
    resolverOptions={generateResolverOptions({"basePath": "/schemas"})} 
    title="Device Schema"
    />
</details>

## Example

```json
{
    "rules": [
        {
            "name": "Turn Off Coffee Machine",
            "precondition": [
                {
                    "type": "Device",
                    "device": "coffee_machine",
                    "condition": {
                        "name": "Number of Coffees Made",
                        "operator": ">=",
                        "value": 3
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "Time",
                    "condition": {
                        "variable": "minute",
                        "operator": ">=",
                        "value": 10
                    }
                }
            ],
            "action": [
                {
                    "type": "Device_Interaction",
                    "device": "coffee_machine",
                    "interaction": {
                        "name": "Power",
                        "value": false
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Rule Components

A rule consist of precondition(s) and action(s)

1. **Preconditions**: Define when rules trigger based on:
   - Device properties
   - Time conditions
   - Context conditions of the user
   - Current task


2. **Actions**: Specify what happens when preconditions are met:
   - Change device states
   - Issue explanations (internal explanation engine)

### Precondition

A rule can have multiple preconditions. To create a rule with multiple preconditions, create an array of objects that contain the precondition objects.

:::info

All preconditions must satisfy to trigger the rule's actions.

:::

#### Device properties

A rule can depend on a device's property to trigger. To create a such precondition, create an object with the propreties `type`, `device`, and `condition`.

The value of `type` is set to `Device`, `device` is set to the device's name ID.

In the `condition`, `name` is the property name, `operator` is the comparison operator, and `value` is the value to compare against.

```json
{
    "type": "Device",
    "device": "coffee_machine",
    "condition": {
        "name": "Number of Coffees Made",
        "operator": ">=",
        "value": 3
    }
}
```

#### Time conditions

A rule can depend on the current time to trigger. To create a such precondition, create an object with the propreties `type` and `condition`.

The value of `type` is set to `Time`, `condition` is an object with `variable`, `operator`, and `value`.

The value of `variable` is set to the time variable (this can be either `minute` or `hour`), `operator` is the comparison operator, and `value` is the value to compare against.

```json
{
    "type": "Time",
    "condition": {
        "variable": "minute",
        "operator": ">=",
        "value": 10
    }
}
```
#### Context conditions

A rule can depend on the user's context to trigger. To create a such precondition, create an object with the propreties `type` and `condition`.

The value of `type` is set to `Context`, `condition` is an object with `variable`, `operator`, and `value`.

The value of `variable` is set to the context variable (this can be any variable which has been passed when initiating a user session via the base64-encoded JSON object, such as group), `operator` is the comparison operator, and `value` is the value to compare against.

```json
{
    "type": "Context",
    "condition": {
        "variable": "group",
        "operator": "==",
        "value": "1"
    }
}
```

#### Current task

A rule can depend on the user's current task to trigger. To create a such precondition, create an object with the propreties `type` and `condition`.

The value of `type` is set to `Context`, `condition` is an object with `variable`, `operator`, and `value`.

The value of `variable` is set to `task`, `operator` is the comparison operator (here, it should be `==`), and `value` is the task ID to compare against.

```json
{
    "type": "Context",
    "condition": {
        "variable": "task",
        "operator": "==",
        "value": "deep_fryer"
    }
}
```

### Actions

#### Device interactions

A rule can change a device's state. To create a such action, create an object with the propreties `type`, `device`, and `interaction`.

The value of `type` is set to `Device_Interaction`, `device` is set to the device's name ID.

In the `interaction`, `name` is the property name, and `value` is the value to set.

```json
{
    "type": "Device_Interaction",
    "device": "coffee_machine",
    "interaction": {
        "name": "Power",
        "value": false
    }
}
```

#### Explanations

A rule can issue an explanation. To create a such action, create an object with the propreties `type` and `explanation`.

The value of `type` is set to `Explanation`, `explanation` is the explanation ID which correspond to the ID in `explanation.json`.

```json
{
    "type": "Explanation",
    "explanation": "coffee_01"
}
```


## Best Practices

 - Design intentional contradictions if your goal is to create confusing situations
 - Test rule interactions thoroughly

 :::important Rule Design
Use rules if you want to create impossible tasks:
- Design contradictions between goals and rules
- Create cascading rule effects
- Ensure impossibility is clear but not immediately obvious
