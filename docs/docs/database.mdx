# Database

V-SHINE uses a MongoDB database with five collections that are created upon session start and logging:
- `devices`: Stores user device variables
- `explanations`: Stores user explanations along with rating metadata
- `logs`: Stores user actions during gameplay
- `sessions`: Stores general user data
- `tasks`: Stores user task progress

## Table

### Devices

The `devices` table stores user device variables as JSON objects. Each JSON object contains device variable data for one user's device.
For scenarios with multiple devices, the table stores several JSON objects per user.

**Example**

```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "6890802b170e8ab76cd90c50"
  },
  "userSessionId": "a9297ea7-8f3a-4fcd-abd3-ae3bed267494",
  "deviceId": "deep_fryer",
  "deviceInteraction": [
    {
      "name": "Power",
      "type": "Boolean_Action",
      "value": false
    },
    {
      "name": "Temperature",
      "type": "Numerical_Action",
      "value": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

- `userSessionId`: User Session ID, references `sessions.sessionId`
- `deviceId`: Device ID, matches device `id` in `game.json`
- `deviceInteraction`: Array of JSON objects for each device interaction, containing the interaction name, type, and current value

### Logs

The `logs` table stores user logs created during gameplay through user actions.

**Example**

```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "6890802e170e8ab76cd90c55"
  },
  "type": "TASK_BEGIN",
  "metadata": {
    "task_id": "deep_fryer"
  },
  "timestamp": 1754300462,
  "userSessionId": "a9297ea7-8f3a-4fcd-abd3-ae3bed267494"
}
```

- `type`: Log type, see [Log Types](#log-types) section below
- `metadata`: Metadata for relevant log types, such as task ID
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp of log creation
- `userSessionId`: User Session ID, references `sessions.sessionId`

#### Log Types

The platform generates various log types through the Logger class. Each log entry includes a timestamp and session ID, with specific metadata based on the log type:

##### RULE_TRIGGER
Logged when automated rules are triggered in the smart home environment.

Metadata:
- `rule_id`: ID of the triggered rule
- `rule_action`: Action performed by the rule

Logged when a user starts a new task.

Metadata:
- `task_id`: ID of the task being started

Logged when a user successfully completes a task.

Metadata:
- `task_id`: ID of the completed task

##### TASK_TIMEOUT
Logged when a task exceeds its time limit.

Metadata:
- `task_id`: ID of the task that timed out

##### ABORT_TASK
Logged when a user or system aborts a task.

Metadata:
- `task_id`: ID of the aborted task
- `abort_reason`: Reason for task abortion

##### DEVICE_INTERACTION
Logged when a user interacts with smart home devices.

Metadata:
- Device-specific interaction data (varies by device type and interaction)

###### WALL_SWITCH
Logged when user switches between walls in a room.

Metadata:
- `room`: Name of the room
- `wall`: Wall identifier being switched to

###### ENTER_DEVICE_CLOSEUP
Logged when user enters device closeup/interaction mode.

Metadata:
- `device`: Device identifier being accessed

###### EXIT_DEVICE_CLOSEUP
Logged when user exits device closeup mode.

Metadata:
- `device`: Device identifier being exited

###### ROOM_SWITCH
Logged when user navigates between different rooms via doors.

Metadata:
- `destination_room`: Target room being navigated to
- `destination_wall`: Target wall within the destination room

### Sessions

The `sessions` table stores general data, including session/socket ID, start time, last activity time, custom user data, screen size, and user agent.

**Example**

```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "6890802b170e8ab76cd90c4c"
  },
  "sessionId": "a9297ea7-8f3a-4fcd-abd3-ae3bed267494",
  "startTime": {
    "$date": "2025-08-04T09:40:59.417Z"
  },
  "lastActivity": {
    "$date": "2025-08-04T09:40:59.417Z"
  },
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/138.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
  "screenSize": {
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 665
  },
  "isCompleted": true,
  "completionTime": {
    "$date": "2025-08-04T09:44:09.273Z"
  },
  "customData": {
    "Condition": 2,
    "Technical_Interest": "interested",
    "User_Name": "John"
  },
  "explanation_cache": null,
  "socketId": "ODKC-GRRXqG6JI_CAAAD"
}
```

### Tasks

The `tasks` table stores user task progress as JSON objects. Each JSON object contains information about one user's task.
Similar to devices, multiple JSON objects exist for multiple tasks per user.

  "task_order": 0,
  "taskDescription": "Turn on the deep fryer",
  "isCompleted": false,
  "isAborted": false,
  "isTimedOut": true,
  "completionTime": null,
  "abortedReason": null,

### Explanations

The `explanations` table stores explanations issued to users.

**Example**

```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "68a441d567cee9ab1e3d0f8d"
  },
  "explanation_id": "13a674b5-b762-4650-8101-2fbe7e5d08cd",
