# Walls

Each room has four walls that can be navigated in the game using the left/right arrow to switch from one wall to another.

## JSON Schema

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={ WallSchema } resolverOptions={generateResolverOptions({"basePath": "/schemas"})} />

<CodeBlock language="json-schema">{JSON.stringify(WallSchema, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>

<InlineSchemaDisplay 
  schema={WallSchema} 
  resolverOptions={generateResolverOptions({"basePath": "/schemas"})} 
  title="Wall Schema"
/>

## Order of Wall

The order of the walls is determined by the order through the array.

Let's assume we have an array of four walls

```json title="Example Array of four walls"
[
    {
        "image": "assets/images/kitchen/first_wall.jpg",
        "devices": [
            { ... }
        ]
    },
        {
        "image": "assets/images/kitchen/second_wall.jpg",
        "devices": [
            { ... }
        ]
    },
        {
        "image": "assets/images/kitchen/third_wall.jpg",
        "devices": [
            { ... }
        ]
    },
        {
        "image": "assets/images/kitchen/fourth_wall.jpg",
        "devices": [
            { ... }
        ]
    },
]
```

If a user would navigate using the right arrow using this example, the order will be:

first_wall.jpg → second_wall.jpg → third_wall.jpg → fourth_wall.jpg



If a user would now navigate using the left arrow, the order will be:

first_wall → fourth_wall.jpg → third_wall.jpg → second_wall.jpg

## Default Wall

If a room and, thus one of the walls, should become visible upon starting the study, it should be marked as default wall.
This can be done by setting the `default` property of one of the walls to `true`.

```json title="Example Array of four walls with default values"
[
    {
        "image": "assets/images/kitchen/first_wall.jpg",
        "default": false,
        "devices": [
            { ... }
        ]
    },
        {
        "image": "assets/images/kitchen/second_wall.jpg",
        "default": true,
        "devices": [
            { ... }
        ]
    },
        {
        "image": "assets/images/kitchen/third_wall.jpg",
        "default": false,
        "devices": [
            { ... }
        ]
    },
        {
        "image": "assets/images/kitchen/fourth_wall.jpg",
        "default": false,
        "devices": [
            { ... }
        ]
    },
]
```

In this example `second_wall.jpg` is the default wall and is shown upon start.

Also, all other walls have the property for `default` set to `false`. This is optional as the value of `default` will be set to `false` automatically if it's not explicitly set.

## Doors

To navigate between rooms, doors can be added to the array `doors`

```json title="Example Array of four walls with default values"
[
    {
        "image": "assets/images/kitchen/first_wall.jpg",
        "default": false,
        "devices": [
            { ... }
        ],
        "doors": [
            {
                "image": "assets/images/bob_room/doors/wall1_door.webp",
                "position": {
                    "x": 0,
                    "y": 24,
                    "scale": 0.5
                },
                "destination": {
                    "room": "shared_room",
                    "wall": "wall1"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Hereby, the image of the door is added to variable `image`, the position is defined in the `position` object with parameters `x` for the x-position, `y` for the y-position and `scale` for the scale of the door image.

Further, the destination is defined in the `destination` object with `room` being the target room and `wall` being the wall number, where wall1 is the first object from the room wall's array, wall2 the second object from the room wall's array, ... .
